# The Exoplanet Catalog (ExoCat)


![alt text](https://github.com/spacetelescope/exocat/blob/master/exocat/exocat-logo-2.png)


This repository hosts the back-end of HST/WFC3's Exoplanet Catalog, ExoCat, which tabulates the status of competed and planned observations of transiting exoplanets by the WFC3 IR instrument, both proposed and completed. It serves the community by helping reduce target duplication and redundant effort in proposal preparation.

Users can search for a target using the target name or RA/DEC coordinates to see what observation programs already exist. Users can also check the status of their program(s) by searching for the proposal ID. 

ExoCat is currently hosted by STScI and can be found here: https://www.stsci.edu/~WFC3/exocat/exocat/exocat.html
